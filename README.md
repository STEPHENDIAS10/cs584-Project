Project motivation: 
Our primary motivation is to understand and gain perspective over why and where crimes occur in terms of the location of the crimes, weapons used, laws broken and hopefully contribute to creating more awareness and predictability of these occurrences.

Project goal:
Our project goal is to study:
1.	What are the major types of crimes and where do they generally occur by classifying the crimes based on the type of crime and incident place (private house, apartment, parking lot. etc).
2.	The location of the crimes and find if certain locations are prone to increased frequency of certain crimes and understand if any correlation exists.
3.	Be able to predict the type of crime based on certain factors such as the time of the crime, description, weapons used, incident place, location in the city and other factors.
